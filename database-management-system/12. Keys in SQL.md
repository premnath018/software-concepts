### **Sample Table: Employees**

| EmployeeID | Name    | Email                                         | SSN         | Department |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 101        | Alice   | [alice@email.com](mailto:alice@email.com)     | 123-45-6789 | HR         |
| 102        | Bob     | [bob@email.com](mailto:bob@email.com)         | 987-65-4321 | IT         |

### **1. Primary Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **primary key** uniquely identifies each record.
- It cannot be `NULL` and must be unique.
- Only **one primary key** is allowed per table.

#### Extracted from Table:

- **Primary Key:** `EmployeeID`  
    (Each value is unique and not null.)

---

### **2. Candidate Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **candidate key** is any column that could serve as a primary key.
- A table can have multiple candidate keys.

#### Extracted from Table:

- **Candidate Keys:** `EmployeeID`, `SSN`, `Email`  
    (Each of these can uniquely identify a record.)

---

### **3. Super Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **super key** is a set of one or more columns that uniquely identify a row.
- Every **candidate key** is a **super key**, but a **super key** may have extra attributes.

#### Extracted from Table:

- **Super Keys:**
    - (`EmployeeID`)
    - (`Email`)
    - (`SSN`)
    - (`EmployeeID`, `Name`)
    - (`Email`, `Department`)

---

### **4. Foreign Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **foreign key** in one table refers to the primary key in another.
- It maintains **referential integrity** between tables.

#### Example:

Assume there is another table **Payroll**:

|PayrollID|EmployeeID|Salary|
|---|---|---|
|1|101|5000|
|2|102|6000|
|3|103|5500|

- Here, `EmployeeID` in **Payroll** is a **foreign key** referencing `EmployeeID` in **Employees**.

---

### **5. Composite Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **composite key** consists of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record.
- Used when a single column isn’t sufficient to ensure uniqueness.

#### Example:

If we have a **Projects** table:

|EmployeeID|ProjectID|Role|
|---|---|---|
|101|P001|Manager|
|102|P002|Developer|
|103|P001|Analyst|

- The **composite key** is (`EmployeeID`, `ProjectID`) since a single employee may work on multiple projects, but their combination is unique.

---

### **6. Alternate Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **candidate key** that is **not chosen** as the primary key.

#### Extracted from Table:

- **Alternate Keys:** `Email`, `SSN`  
    (If `EmployeeID` is chosen as the primary key, these remain unique but not primary.)

---

### **7. Unique Key**

#### Explanation:

- Ensures unique values in a column but allows `NULL`.
- Unlike a primary key, a **unique key** does not have to be a single column.

#### Extracted from Table:

- **Unique Key:** `Email`  
    (Each employee must have a unique email.)

---

### **8. Surrogate Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **surrogate key** is a system-generated unique identifier.
- It has no business meaning.

#### Example:

If **EmployeeID** is an **auto-incremented number**, it acts as a **surrogate key**.

---

### **9. Artificial Key**

#### Explanation:

- A **manually created** key when no natural unique key exists.

#### Example:

If `EmployeeID` was manually assigned instead of auto-generated, it would be an **artificial key**.

---

### **10. Natural Key**

#### Explanation:

- A key derived from real-world attributes (e.g., SSN, Email).

#### Extracted from Table:

- **Natural Keys:** `SSN`, `Email`  
    (These exist outside the database and uniquely identify people.)
