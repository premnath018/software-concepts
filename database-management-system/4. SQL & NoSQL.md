### **1. What is SQL?**

SQL (**Structured Query Language**) databases are **relational databases** that use **structured schemas** to store data in tables with predefined columns and relationships. Examples: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server**.

### **2. What is NoSQL?**

NoSQL (**Not Only SQL**) databases are **non-relational** and provide **flexibility in data storage** by using key-value pairs, documents, wide-columns, or graphs. Examples: **MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB**.

## **Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL**

|Feature|**SQL (Relational DBMS)**|**NoSQL (Non-Relational DBMS)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Structure**|Tables (Rows & Columns)|Key-Value, Documents, Wide-Column, Graph|
|**Schema**|Fixed Schema (Structured)|Flexible Schema (Unstructured or Semi-structured)|
|**Scalability**|Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)|Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)|
|**ACID Compliance**|Yes (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)|No (Uses Eventual Consistency in many cases)|
|**Performance**|Slower for large, unstructured data|Faster for unstructured and distributed data|
|**Best for**|Complex queries, structured data|High-speed, large-scale data, flexible models|
|**Joins & Relationships**|Supports joins and relationships|No joins (Denormalized approach)|
|**Transactions**|Strong consistency|Eventual consistency (for scalability)|
|**Query Language**|SQL (Structured Query Language)|No fixed query language (Uses JSON, BSON, etc.)|

## **Use Cases of SQL**

SQL databases are ideal when:  
✅ **Data is structured and requires relationships** (e.g., e-commerce orders, bank transactions).  
✅ **ACID compliance is critical** (e.g., financial applications, booking systems).  
✅ **Complex queries and reporting** are needed (e.g., business intelligence, analytics).

### **Examples**:

- **E-Commerce**: Order management, user details, and transactions.
- **Banking**: Account balances, loans, and transactions.
- **Healthcare**: Patient records and appointments.

## **Use Cases of NoSQL**

NoSQL databases are preferred when:  
✅ **Data is unstructured, semi-structured, or dynamic** (e.g., IoT, social media).  
✅ **High-speed, real-time data processing is needed** (e.g., chat applications, leaderboards).  
✅ **Scalability is crucial** (e.g., handling millions of users with distributed systems).

### **Examples**:

- **Social Media**: Facebook uses **Cassandra**, Instagram uses **MongoDB**.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Google uses **Bigtable**, Netflix uses **DynamoDB**.
- **IoT Applications**: Storing real-time sensor data in **Redis**.

## **Which One Should You Choose?**

- Use **SQL** for structured, reliable, transactional data with relationships.
- Use **NoSQL** for high-speed, flexible, large-scale distributed data.
