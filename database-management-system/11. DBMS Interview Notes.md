## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Schema of MongoDB**

### **üîπ What is a Schema?**

A **schema** defines the structure of data in a database. Unlike SQL databases, **MongoDB is schema-less**, meaning documents (records) in a collection can have different structures.

### **üîπ Example Schema in MongoDB**

#### **User Collection (JSON Document)**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("123abc"),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  },
  "skills": ["MongoDB", "Node.js", "React"]
}
```

Here:

- `_id`: Unique identifier (ObjectId)
- **Nested Objects**: `address` is an embedded document
- **Array Fields**: `skills` is an array

### **üîπ Flexible vs. Rigid Schema**

|**Feature**|**MongoDB (NoSQL - Flexible)**|**SQL Databases (Rigid Schema)**|
|---|---|---|
|Schema Enforcement|No fixed schema|Strictly defined schema|
|Data Format|JSON-like BSON|Tables, Rows, Columns|
|Flexibility|Can store different fields per document|Must follow predefined columns|

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Situations Where MongoDB is Used**

MongoDB is used in cases where **high scalability, flexible schema, and fast data access** are needed.

### **üîπ When to Use MongoDB?**

‚úÖ **Big Data Applications** ‚Äì Handles large volumes of unstructured data.  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Analytics** ‚Äì Fast retrieval without joins.  
‚úÖ **Content Management Systems** ‚Äì Flexible schema supports dynamic fields.  
‚úÖ **IoT and Sensor Data** ‚Äì Stores time-series data efficiently.  
‚úÖ **E-commerce Platforms** ‚Äì Stores product catalogs with varied attributes.

### **üîπ When NOT to Use MongoDB?**

‚ùå When you need **ACID transactions** (MongoDB has limited support).  
‚ùå If you have **complex joins** across multiple tables (SQL is better).  
‚ùå When your data is **highly relational and structured**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison: Relational vs Non-Relational Databases**

|**Feature**|**SQL (Relational DB)**|**NoSQL (MongoDB, etc.)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Schema**|Fixed schema (tables)|Dynamic schema (JSON/BSON)|
|**Scalability**|Vertical (Add more power to a single server)|Horizontal (Distribute across servers)|
|**Joins**|Uses joins efficiently|Avoids joins, uses embedded documents|
|**Transactions**|ACID-compliant|BASE (Eventual consistency)|
|**Use Cases**|Banking, ERP, CRM|Big data, IoT, Social media|

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison: MongoDB vs SQL**

|**Feature**|**MongoDB (NoSQL)**|**SQL Databases**|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Model**|Document-based (JSON)|Table-based|
|**Schema**|Schema-less|Fixed schema|
|**Scaling**|Horizontally (Sharding)|Vertically (More CPU/RAM)|
|**Query Language**|JavaScript-like JSON Queries|SQL (Structured Query Language)|
|**Speed**|Faster for read/write-heavy apps|Better for complex queries|

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Query: Maximum Marks for Each Subject**

Given **Tables**:

```sql
-- Table 1: Student
CREATE TABLE Student (
    name VARCHAR(50),
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    subject_name VARCHAR(50),
    marks INT
);

-- Table 2: Subject
CREATE TABLE Subject (
    subject_name VARCHAR(50),
    faculty VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### **üîπ SQL Query to Get Maximum Marks for Each Subject**

```sql
SELECT subject_name, MAX(marks) AS highest_marks
FROM Student
GROUP BY subject_name;
```

**üîπ Explanation:**

- **`GROUP BY subject_name`** groups students based on the subject.
- **`MAX(marks)`** fetches the highest mark per subject.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Joins in SQL**

### **üîπ INNER JOIN vs NATURAL JOIN**

|**Join Type**|**Definition**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**INNER JOIN**|Returns matching rows from both tables|`SELECT * FROM Student INNER JOIN Subject ON Student.subject_name = Subject.subject_name;`|
|**NATURAL JOIN**|Auto-matches common columns (without ON)|`SELECT * FROM Student NATURAL JOIN Subject;`|

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Transactions & Concurrency Control**

A **transaction** in DBMS is a **set of SQL statements** that must be executed **fully** or not at all.

### **üîπ ACID Properties**

|**Property**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Atomicity**|All steps execute or none do (rollback on failure).|
|**Consistency**|Maintains database integrity.|
|**Isolation**|Multiple transactions don‚Äôt interfere.|
|**Durability**|Committed changes are permanent.|

### **üîπ Example of SQL Transaction**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Student SET marks = 95 WHERE id = 101;
INSERT INTO Student (name, id, subject_name, marks) VALUES ('Alice', 102, 'Math', 85);
COMMIT;
```

- If an error occurs, use `ROLLBACK;` to undo changes.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Query Optimization Techniques**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Plan Analysis**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM Student WHERE marks > 80;
```

- Helps find slow queries.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Indexing**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_marks ON Student(marks);
```

- Speeds up lookups in large datasets.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Query Caching**

- Store frequently executed query results in **Redis/Memcached**.

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Sharding, Replication, Partitioning**

|**Concept**|**Definition**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Sharding**|Splitting data across multiple databases|Social media posts distributed across servers|
|**Replication**|Copying data to multiple servers|Read replicas in MySQL improve query speed|
|**Partitioning**|Storing different parts of a table separately|Banking DB partitioned by region|

### **üîπ Problem with CAP Theorem in Sharding, Replication, and Partitioning**

- **CAP Theorem:** A database can provide **only two** out of **Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance**.
- **Issue in Sharding:** When a shard fails, data consistency is lost.
- **Issue in Replication:** If master and replica get out of sync, stale data is served.
- **Issue in Partitioning:** Queries spanning multiple partitions are slow.
