## **1. Transactions in DBMS**

A **transaction** in DBMS is a **logical unit of work** that consists of one or more SQL operations. It ensures **data integrity** and follows the **ACID properties**:

- **Atomicity**: The transaction is **all or nothing**. If any part fails, the entire transaction rolls back.
- **Consistency**: The database remains **consistent** before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions execute **independently** without affecting others.
- **Durability**: Once committed, the changes are **permanent**, even if the system crashes.

### **Example Transaction (Bank Transfer)**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 500 WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Debit
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 500 WHERE AccountID = 2; -- Credit
COMMIT;
```

If any statement **fails**, the transaction **rolls back**.

## **2. Concurrency Control in DBMS**

Concurrency control ensures that multiple transactions can execute **simultaneously** while maintaining **data integrity**.

### **Why is Concurrency Control Needed?**

Without concurrency control, problems like the following can occur:

1. **Dirty Read**: Reading uncommitted changes.
2. **Lost Update**: One transaction overwrites another's changes.
3. **Non-Repeatable Read**: A row changes during a transaction.
4. **Phantom Read**: New rows appear in repeated queries.

---

## **3. Locking Mechanisms**

Locks are used to **control concurrent access** to database resources.

### **Types of Locks**

üîπ **1. Shared Lock (S)**:

- Allows **read-only** access to a resource.
- **Multiple transactions** can hold a shared lock at the same time.
- Example: Reading a bank balance.

üîπ **2. Exclusive Lock (X)**:

- Allows **read and write** access to a resource.
- **Only one transaction** can hold an exclusive lock at a time.
- Example: Updating a bank balance.

### **Locking Example**

```sql
-- Transaction 1 (T1)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1 FOR UPDATE;
-- T1 has an exclusive lock on AccountID 1

-- Transaction 2 (T2) tries to read the same row
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Blocked until T1 commits or rolls back
```

üöÄ **Real-World Example**: Online **railway ticket booking** prevents two users from booking the same seat simultaneously.

---

## **4. Deadlocks**

A **deadlock** occurs when two transactions are **waiting for each other** to release locks, causing an infinite wait.

### **Deadlock Example**

#### **Transaction 1 (T1)**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 500 WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Locks AccountID = 1
WAIT... (T2 locks AccountID = 2)
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 500 WHERE AccountID = 2; -- Waiting for T2
```

#### **Transaction 2 (T2)**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 500 WHERE AccountID = 2; -- Locks AccountID = 2
WAIT... (T1 locks AccountID = 1)
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 500 WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Waiting for T1
```

üí• **Deadlock occurs** because **T1 waits for T2 and T2 waits for T1**.

### **Deadlock Prevention Strategies**

1. **Timeouts**: If a transaction waits too long, it rolls back.
2. **Deadlock Detection**: The database detects circular waits and rolls back one transaction.
3. **Lock Ordering**: Always acquire locks in a specific order (e.g., first lock AccountID 1, then lock AccountID 2).

## **5. Isolation Levels**

**Isolation levels** define how transactions interact with each other and affect concurrency.

### **Types of Isolation Levels in SQL**

|Isolation Level|Dirty Read|Non-Repeatable Read|Phantom Read|Performance|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Read Uncommitted**|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|üöÄ Fastest|
|**Read Committed**|‚ùå No|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|‚ö° Fast|
|**Repeatable Read**|‚ùå No|‚ùå No|‚úÖ Yes|üîÑ Moderate|
|**Serializable**|‚ùå No|‚ùå No|‚ùå No|üêå Slowest|

### **1. Read Uncommitted**

- **Lowest isolation level**.
- Transactions **can read uncommitted (dirty) data**.
- **Fastest**, but risky.

**Example**:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;
```

üö® **Risk**: A transaction reads data that may later be **rolled back**.

---

### **2. Read Committed (Default in SQL Server, PostgreSQL)**

- Transactions **can only read committed data**.
- **Prevents dirty reads** but allows **non-repeatable reads**.

**Example**:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;
```

üöÄ **Use Case**: Banking applications to prevent **dirty reads**.

---

### **3. Repeatable Read (Default in MySQL)**

- **Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads**.
- A transaction **always sees the same data** even if another transaction updates it.
- **Phantom reads can still occur**.

**Example**:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;
```

üöÄ **Use Case**: **E-commerce carts** to ensure prices don't change during checkout.

---

### **4. Serializable (Strictest, Slowest)**

- **Prevents all concurrency issues** but **reduces performance**.
- Transactions **execute one after another**, like a queue.

**Example**:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = 1;
```

üöÄ **Use Case**: **Stock trading systems**, where race conditions **must be avoided**.

## **Summary**

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Transaction**|Group of SQL operations that follow ACID properties.|
|**Concurrency Control**|Ensures multiple transactions run smoothly.|
|**Locking**|Used to control access (Shared & Exclusive locks).|
|**Deadlocks**|Occurs when two transactions wait on each other.|
|**Isolation Levels**|Define transaction behavior when multiple transactions access the same data.|

## **Final Thoughts**

- ‚úÖ Use **Read Committed** for most applications.
- ‚úÖ Use **Repeatable Read** for **data consistency** (e.g., shopping carts).
- ‚úÖ Use **Serializable** for **high data accuracy** (e.g., stock trading).
- ‚úÖ Prevent **deadlocks** by following **lock ordering** and **timeouts**.
