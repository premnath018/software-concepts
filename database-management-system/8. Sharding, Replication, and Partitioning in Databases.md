## **1. Sharding**

Sharding is a **database scaling technique** that splits a large dataset into smaller, independent pieces called **shards**, which are distributed across multiple database instances.

### **Why Use Sharding?**

âœ… **Improves Performance** â€“ Reduces query load on a single database.  
âœ… **Enhances Scalability** â€“ Allows horizontal scaling across multiple servers.  
âœ… **Avoids Bottlenecks** â€“ Prevents a single server from handling all requests.

### **Types of Sharding**

1. **Range-Based Sharding**
    
    - Splits data based on a range of values.
    - Example: Users with IDs **1-1000** go to Shard 1, **1001-2000** go to Shard 2.
    - âš  **Issue**: Uneven distribution if data isn't uniform.
2. **Hash-Based Sharding**
    
    - Uses a **hash function** to distribute data.
    - Example: `UserID % 3 â†’ Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3`.
    - âœ… Provides **even distribution**, but harder to query across shards.
3. **Geographic Sharding**
    
    - Data is **sharded based on location**.
    - Example: **Users from Asia in Shard 1, Europe in Shard 2**.
    - âœ… Improves **latency for region-specific queries**.

### **Example of Sharding**

Imagine an **e-commerce platform** like Amazon:

- **Shard 1**: Customers from the USA
- **Shard 2**: Customers from Europe
- **Shard 3**: Customers from Asia  
    Each shard operates independently, reducing the load on a single database.

## **2. Replication**

Replication means **copying data from one database server to another** to ensure **high availability and fault tolerance**.

### **Why Use Replication?**

âœ… **Fault Tolerance** â€“ If one server fails, another takes over.  
âœ… **Improved Read Performance** â€“ Read operations can be distributed across multiple replicas.  
âœ… **Disaster Recovery** â€“ Prevents data loss by maintaining copies.

### **Types of Replication**

1. **Master-Slave Replication**
    - **Master** handles **writes**, **Slaves** handle **reads**.
    - Example: **MySQL Replication**.
    - âœ… Improves **read performance**, but **writes** still go to a single master.
2. **Master-Master Replication**
    - **Multiple masters** handle **both reads and writes**.
    - Example: Used in **multi-region applications**.
    - âš  **Conflict resolution** needed when two masters update the same data.
3. **Log-Based Replication**
    - Uses database logs to replicate changes.
    - Example: **PostgreSQLâ€™s WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**.

### **Example of Replication**

- **Banking Systems**: Transactions are replicated in real time to ensure no data is lost.
- **Content Delivery**: Video streaming sites **replicate databases globally** to reduce latency.

## **3. Partitioning**

Partitioning **divides a single database table into smaller, manageable pieces** for better performance and manageability.

### **Why Use Partitioning?**

âœ… **Speeds Up Queries** â€“ Only relevant partitions are scanned.  
âœ… **Easier Management** â€“ Large datasets are split into smaller pieces.  
âœ… **Efficient Storage** â€“ Cold data can be stored on cheaper storage.

### **Types of Partitioning**

4. **Range Partitioning**
    - Data is stored based on a range of values.
    - Example: **Orders from 2020 in Partition 1, Orders from 2021 in Partition 2**.
5. **List Partitioning**
    - Data is partitioned based on specific values.
    - Example: Customers from **India in Partition 1, USA in Partition 2**.
6. **Hash Partitioning**
    - Uses a hash function to distribute data.
    - Example: `OrderID % 4 â†’ Partition 1, Partition 2, Partition 3, Partition 4`.
7. **Composite Partitioning**
    - Combination of multiple partitioning methods.
    - Example: **Range + Hash Partitioning**.

### **Example of Partitioning**

- **Social Media Database**: Posts can be **partitioned by year** for better performance.
- **Healthcare Systems**: Patient records are partitioned by **region**.

# **ðŸ”¥ Interview Questions with Answers**

### **1. Sharding**

ðŸ”¹ **What is sharding, and why is it useful?**  
âœ… Sharding is a database architecture that **splits data into smaller parts** across multiple servers to improve performance.

ðŸ”¹ **What are the challenges of sharding?**  
ðŸš¨ **Complex queries** across shards, **data consistency**, **rebalancing shards**.

---

### **2. Replication**

ðŸ”¹ **What is the difference between replication and sharding?**  
âœ… **Replication** copies the same data to multiple locations, while **sharding** distributes different parts of data across multiple databases.

ðŸ”¹ **What are the advantages of replication?**  
âœ… **High availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery**.

ðŸ”¹ **What is the difference between Master-Slave and Master-Master replication?**  
âœ… **Master-Slave**: **Only the master** handles writes, **slaves handle reads**.  
âœ… **Master-Master**: **Both servers** handle reads and writes.
