SQL **JOIN** is used to **combine rows** from two or more tables based on a **related column** between them. There are different types of joins, each serving different purposes.

---
## **1. INNER JOIN**

### **Explanation**

- Returns **only the matching rows** from both tables.
- If there‚Äôs **no match**, the row is **not included** in the result.

### **Example**

#### **Tables**
**Customers Table**

| CustomerID | Name | Country |
| ---------- | ---- | ------- |
| 1          | John | USA     |
| 2          | Alex | Canada  |
| 3          | Mike | UK      |

**Orders Table**

|OrderID|CustomerID|Product|
|---|---|---|
|101|1|Laptop|
|102|2|Phone|
|103|4|Tablet|

#### **Query**

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

#### **Output**

|CustomerID|Name|OrderID|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|John|101|Laptop|
|2|Alex|102|Phone|

üìå **Note**:

- **Mike (CustomerID = 3)** is **not included** because he has **no matching order**.
- **Order 103 (CustomerID = 4)** is **not included** because there is **no matching customer**.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

- **Bank Transactions**: Get all customers who have made transactions.
- **E-commerce**: Find users who have purchased something.

---

## **2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**

### **Explanation**

- Returns **all rows from the left table** and the **matching rows from the right table**.
- If there‚Äôs **no match in the right table**, it fills with **NULL**.

#### **Query**

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

#### **Output**

|CustomerID|Name|OrderID|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|John|101|Laptop|
|2|Alex|102|Phone|
|3|Mike|NULL|NULL|

üìå **Note**:

- **Mike (CustomerID = 3)** is included **even though he has no order**, with NULL values.
- **Order 103 (CustomerID = 4)** is **not included** because **Customers is the left table**.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

- **Find all employees and their assigned projects** (some employees may not have projects).
- **List all students and their assigned courses** (some students may not have enrolled yet).

---

## **3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**

### **Explanation**

- Returns **all rows from the right table** and the **matching rows from the left table**.
- If there‚Äôs **no match in the left table**, it fills with **NULL**.

#### **Query**

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

#### **Output**

|CustomerID|Name|OrderID|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|John|101|Laptop|
|2|Alex|102|Phone|
|NULL|NULL|103|Tablet|

üìå **Note**:

- **Order 103 (CustomerID = 4)** is included **even though there‚Äôs no matching customer**, with NULL values.
- **Mike (CustomerID = 3)** is **not included** because **Orders is the right table** and he has no orders.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

- **Find all orders and their customers** (even if some orders don‚Äôt have a customer).
- **Find all sales and their associated employees** (even if some sales have no assigned employee).

---

## **4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**

### **Explanation**

- Returns **all records from both tables**.
- If there‚Äôs **no match**, fills with **NULL**.

#### **Query**

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
FULL JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

#### **Output**

|CustomerID|Name|OrderID|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|John|101|Laptop|
|2|Alex|102|Phone|
|3|Mike|NULL|NULL|
|NULL|NULL|103|Tablet|

üìå **Note**:

- **Mike (CustomerID = 3) is included** even though he has no order.
- **Order 103 (CustomerID = 4) is included** even though it has no customer.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

- **List all students and courses** (even if some students haven‚Äôt enrolled or some courses have no students).
- **Find all employees and projects** (even if some employees are unassigned or some projects have no employee).

---

## **5. CROSS JOIN**

### **Explanation**

- Returns the **Cartesian Product** (every row from table A is combined with every row from table B).
- **No condition is required**.
- Can result in **huge** datasets.

#### **Query**

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
CROSS JOIN Orders;
```

#### **Output**

|CustomerID|Name|OrderID|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|John|101|Laptop|
|1|John|102|Phone|
|1|John|103|Tablet|
|2|Alex|101|Laptop|
|2|Alex|102|Phone|
|2|Alex|103|Tablet|
|3|Mike|101|Laptop|
|3|Mike|102|Phone|
|3|Mike|103|Tablet|

üìå **Note**:

- If **Customers has 3 rows** and **Orders has 3 rows**, the result has **3 √ó 3 = 9 rows**.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

- **Generating all possible product and category combinations**.
- **Finding all possible user and feature test cases** for testing.

## **Comparison Table**

|Join Type|Matching Rows|Non-Matching Rows from Left|Non-Matching Rows from Right|
|---|---|---|---|
|**INNER JOIN**|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No|‚ùå No|
|**LEFT JOIN**|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No|
|**RIGHT JOIN**|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No|‚úÖ Yes|
|**FULL JOIN**|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|
|**CROSS JOIN**|‚úÖ Yes (All Possible Combinations)|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|

---

## **Conclusion**

- Use **INNER JOIN** for **only matching data**.
- Use **LEFT JOIN** when you need **all data from the left table**.
- Use **RIGHT JOIN** when you need **all data from the right table**.
- Use **FULL JOIN** when you need **all data from both tables**.
- Use **CROSS JOIN** for **every possible combination** (be careful with large datasets!).
